			<h1>For My Sweetest and Dearest Muhd Iskandar Farhani</h1>
			</p>I hope this short and simple html message that i did myself (also searched for sources on tiktok) can soften your heart to accept my apologies dengan hati yang terbuka. First things first, i wanted to say that i am deeply in love with you and because of that, i fear of losing you. I can't describe it with bombastic good poetic words but i want to reassure you that im always gonna be by your side no matter what happens, no matter what sort of challenges or ujian we are facing, ups and dowm, laughter and cries, anger and calmness, i want to be by your side at all times, and it is my commitment and my responsibility as your boku no kanojo to do so. I strive to be the best kanojo that i can, with my strength and willpower, i am indeed trying my best, giving my all to you.But sometimes i know i can be imperfect, i have flaws and this is the reason im making this, to apologize for my stupidity.</p>
			<h2>From the bottom of my heart...</h2>
			<p>I am deeply sorry for my actions and i regret it, truly. I kept thinking to myself during assembly, my mood went from happy sunshine to thunders and rain, in fact it did rain heavily about an hour ago. I knew i had to fix it, fix my mistakes. I will never get tired of fixing our arguments and silent treatments, because i do it out of love and nothing else. I dont expect anything in return rather than hoping you will forgive me, as i am a sinful human being and me, Gwendolyn Liew Sue Yen, is sorry for what she had done that made baby boy iskandar terasa.Relationships isnt always rainbow and glitters, imo relationship require deep, soul to soul connection with one another, and im trying to achieve that, to understand you better, to know you deeper so that i can heal you.I want us to be in the same path, same road, same journey with the same goals, which is marriage.I cant thank you enough for the things you did for me, your effort yang mahal, i always appreciate the time and energy you put into me. So, i hope we can forgive and forget, lets reach our first monthsary milestone<3.
			<br><br>I know this is very noob and janky and very the celeron level but i really hope you read this, and i hope i dont dissapoint you again...if so, im sorry for not being able to give out the best of the best :( 
			<br><br>And also, heres my take on a pantun hehe, (warning : cringe dan probably salah)
			<br><br>Di hulu sungai aku berdiri, 
			<br><br>Memandang aliran yang tiada henti, 
			<br><br>Cintaku padamu tak pernah berhenti, 
			<br><br>Mengalir deras bagai sungai yang jerni.
